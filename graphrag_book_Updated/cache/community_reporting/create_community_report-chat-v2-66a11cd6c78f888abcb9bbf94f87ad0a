Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n46,\"\"\"IDC\"\"\",\" The entity known as \"\"IDC\"\" serves multiple roles in the given context. Initially, it is revealed that IDC (Intelligent Distributed Control) is an activated system that has led to an increase in power. However, there are conflicting reports suggesting that IDC may be experiencing issues with starting up or initiating operations.\n\n   Beyond its functional role, IDC is also recognized as an organization involved in various events and transitions. For instance, it appears to be undergoing a transition to ECUPassive on non-matching Network Management. After the completion of STR (Startup Reset), IDC entered a FULL OFF state.\n\n   Furthermore, there are indications that IDC has issued commands or signals, as suggested by the acronym 'IOC_WATCHDOG_RESET'. This command or signal may be related to an event, although it is not explicitly stated.\n\n   The organization IDC may also have a connection with the system BI_2307. There are conflicting reports regarding a system reset performed by IDC. Some sources claim that IDC performed a system reset despite it being recorded as a customer reset in DLT's logs, while others simply state that it performed a system reset.\n\n   Lastly, there is a location associated with IDC where a blackscreen issue occurred with FIT-Fahrzeug's vehicle. Additionally, IDC is identified as the switch that is not forwarding messages from BCP to WAVE. At this location, a yellow screen displaying no ID was observed.\",11\n89,\"\"\"STR\"\"\",\" The entity referred to as \"\"STR\"\" is a significant component within the [BI][HU][IDC][pu2311] system. It has been identified as triggering an exit on timeout, suggesting some form of time-out event or process. However, it's also important to note that \"\"STR\"\" is an abbreviation for a specific event or operation, although the exact meaning remains undisclosed in the provided text.\n\n   In relation to system operations, \"\"STR\"\" appears before RVC during its startup, indicating it might be a device or system entity. Furthermore, \"\"STR\"\" seems to be associated with a location or context where the event WAKEUP_REASON_WATCHDOG_RESET was observed during MGU22_G's operation.\n\n   Additionally, \"\"STR\"\" is linked to an event or operation that led IDC to enter a FULL OFF state. It also refers to the event or process causing the budget fall to zero, identified as STR_ERROR. Lastly, \"\"STR\"\" stands for Suspend To RAM, a state in which a computer can be paused and resumed later, suggesting it might be related to system resumption from a specific condition.\n\n   In summary, \"\"STR\"\" is a multifaceted entity within the given system, associated with various events, operations, and states, although its exact meaning remains partially undefined in the provided descriptions.\",7\n99,\"\"\"DLT\"\"\",\" The entity known as DLT serves as both a location and an organization. In the context of the BI_D2ML MGU22, it has been reported that there is a malfunction with temperature sensors. Additionally, logs from this entity, DLT, suggest that IDC (presumably another entity) executed a system reset within its operations. This information implies that DLT may be a facility or system where both hardware and software issues are being addressed.\",2\n47,\"\"\"HUD\"\"\",\" The Heads-Up Display (HUD), following a profile change, necessitates an adjustment.
