This event is related to a watchdog reset within the organization or system BI -E2-ML [IDC23_E][2311]. It can also signify a specific code or command issued by IDC, and it may require attention or action from IDC or other organizations.\n\nThe event is associated with the Internet Operations Command (IOC), where a watchdog has been reset. It can occur in various locations, such as Wohnen, specifically for individuals J001_TA10023, J001_TA10134, or in the geographical area G045_H021540. The event may indicate a reset or restart of a security system or monitoring process, and it can occur in-flight communications where the watchdog function resets.\n\nThe event occurred on 2023-04-23 18:48:59, and it was reported with reason SHUTDOWN_IOC_WDGM_RESET in Fahren for U010_5V70383.
