During the LifeCycle-RTC event, it remains inactive. This could suggest a temporary pause or maintenance period for specific operations within IDC23.\n\nIDC23 is also identified as a location where Nightly Build BAT takes place, possibly indicating a data center or similar facility. This suggests regular software updates and potentially continuous integration and deployment processes.\n\nIn addition to these functions, IDC23 is involved in the management of the Service RC_ETH_PHY_SWITCH_ENGINE_RESET. This could imply network infrastructure maintenance or troubleshooting activities.\n\nIDC23 has also been linked to several incident reports. It experienced a problem where it did not wake up sporadically after receiving a WUP trigger, suggesting potential power management issues. Furthermore, an unexpected event occurred at IDC23 that led to the restart of the platform due to an IOC Watchdog Reset.\n\nIDC23 has also been involved in incidents related to Ethereum services and Machine Learning (ML) software updates. An Ethereum service crash was reported at IDC23, and a black screen issue occurred after Update 25 (U25) was flashed on the ML software within the organization.\n\nLastly, IDC23 has been associated with specific events such as the restart of a service named 'signalgateway' on a platform, an APIX Chip malfunction in the STR state, and the reporting of a safety violation reset event. These incidents suggest that IDC23 plays a significant role in various system operations and maintenance activities.\",13\n233,\"\"\"SERVICE RC_ETH_PHY_SWITCH_ENGINE_RESET\"\"\",\"\"\"The Service RC_ETH_PHY_SWITCH_ENGINE_RESET is a technical service that returned a negative response.\"\"\",4\n422,\"\"\"IC_SAFTY_VIOLATION_RESET_BLANK\"\"\",\"\"\"IC_SAFTY_VIOLATION_RESET_BLANK is an event related to a safety violation reset.\"\"\",3\n213,\"\"\"NIGHTLY BUILD BAT\"\"\",\" The Nightly Build BAT is a recurring event or process within the organization's schedule, serving as an opportunity for hardware components testing and building.
