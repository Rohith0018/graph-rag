During the LifeCycle-RTC event, it remains inactive. This could suggest a temporary pause or maintenance period for specific operations within IDC23.\n\nIDC23 is also identified as a location where Nightly Build BAT takes place, possibly indicating a data center or similar facility. This suggests regular software updates and potentially continuous integration and deployment processes.\n\nIn addition to these functions, IDC23 is involved in the management of the Service RC_ETH_PHY_SWITCH_ENGINE_RESET. This could imply network infrastructure maintenance or troubleshooting activities.\n\nIDC23 has also been linked to several incident reports. It experienced a problem where it did not wake up sporadically after receiving a WUP trigger, suggesting potential power management issues. Furthermore, an unexpected event occurred at IDC23 that led to the restart of the platform due to an IOC Watchdog Reset.\n\nIDC23 has also been involved in incidents related to Ethereum services and Machine Learning (ML) software updates. An Ethereum service crash was reported at IDC23, and a black screen issue occurred after Update 25 (U25) was flashed on the ML software within the organization.\n\nLastly, IDC23 has been associated with specific events such as the restart of a service named 'signalgateway' on a platform, an APIX Chip malfunction in the STR state, and the reporting of a safety violation reset event. These incidents suggest that IDC23 plays a significant role in various system operations and maintenance activities.\",13\n108,\"\"\"APIX CHIP\"\"\",\"\"\"The APIX Chip is a technology that has malfunctioned in the STR state.\"\"\",2\n107,\"\"\"STR STATE\"\"\",\" The STR State, identified as the geographical location or state where the IDC23 organization resides, is also notable for being the site where the malfunction of the APIX Chip occurred.\",2\n423,\"\"\"DTC 0XB7FB8F\"\"\",\"\"\"DTC 0xB7FB8F is a specific diagnostic trouble code (DTC) related to a safe misc CRC error.\"\"\",1\n334,\"\"\"WUP TRIGGER\"\"\",\"\"\"WUP trigger refers to a wake-up signal sent to IDC23, but it fails to respond properly.\"\"\",1\n335,\"\"\"SHUTDOWN_FULL_OFF\"\"\",\"\"\"SHUTDOWN_FULL_OFF is the state where IDC23 is fully shut down.\"\"\",1\n416,\"\"\"PLATFORM\"\"\",\"\"\"The platform is the system that has been instructed to restart due to the IOC Watchdog Reset.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n16,\"\"\"IDC23\"\"\",\"\"\"HU\"\"\",\"\"\"IDC23 and HU are involved in the crash of the Ethereum service.\"\"\",21\n20,\"\"\"IDC23\"\"\",\"\"\"LIFECYCLE\"\"\",\"\"\"The specific location or device IDC23 is part of the overall lifecycle of the system.\"\"\",18\n17,\"\"\"IDC23\"\"\",\"\"\"LIFECYCLE-RTC\"\"\",\"\"\"The LifeCycle-RTC event occurs at IDC23.\"\"\",17\n22,\"\"\"IDC23\"\"\",\"\"\"SERVICE RC_ETH_PHY_SWITCH_ENGINE_RESET\"\"\",\"\"\"The location IDC23 is where the Service RC_ETH_PHY_SWITCH_ENGINE_RESET is being used or monitored.\"\"\",17\n21,\"\"\"IDC23\"\"\",\"\"\"NIGHTLY BUILD BAT\"\"\",\" The entity known as \"\"IDC23\"\" plays a role in, or is associated with, the Nightly Build BAT process.
